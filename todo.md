# Basic/fixes:
* Bookmarks weren't tested at all, would not recommend trying it.

# Additional:
* "Popularity" of fics read (5/10).
* Canonize tags (7/10).
* Matplotlib charts of word count/hits/kudos. This one will hurt because matplotlib hurts me. Not that pandas and bs4 doesn't. (6/10).
* Make so you can see your wrapped from previous years.
* Implement Rich Python Library, to make the console prettier and more user-friendly to non devs.

# Unsolvable:
* Counts every time you have ever opened the fic, not just in the specified year.
* Counts every fic in your history regardless of if you've read it or not (can urge user to delete works from history they haven't actually read before running to mitigate).
