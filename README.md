# ao3wrapped
Y'know how people went "what if there was an ao3 wrapped. That would be so cursed. I would hate it." Well.

Check out `todo.md` for what might get updated/what needs to be done. Pull requests are absolutely welcome, as you can tell by looking at this code, I have no idea what I'm doing.

If you run into `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'find_all'` when running the program, this is likely because ao3 has rate limited you. Fix incoming (or you're welcome to create a PR).

# How To Use
[Download](https://github.com/teresachenec/ao3wrapped/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or clone this repository (green button at the top, `git clone https://github.com/teresachenec/ao3wrapped.git`) . Have [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and pip/3 installed.

Have the dependencies (listed below) installed. This can be done like this if you're on a Unix machine:
```
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install pandas

pip install InquirerPy
pip install tqdm
```

If you're on a macOS then do `pip3` instead of `pip` like `pip3 install requests`.

Run the program like this:
```
python ao3wrapped.py
```
If you're on macOS then do `python3` instead of `python` like `python3 ao3wrapped.py`.

This will also generate two files:
* `works.csv` - a spreadsheet of the works you read this year
* `user.csv` - a spreadsheet of your stats from this year
